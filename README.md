# Hello-Tomohiro-I-wanted-to-contact-you.
Hello Tomohiro i dont know if you will see this, but i wanted to contact you (and didnt come up with a different way of doing so), before i start I want to tell you who i am and why im i contacting you.


My name is Enrique, and I am a final-year Computer Science student at Universidad Franciso de Victoria (UFV, from Spaim). I am contacting you seeking aid for my Final Year Project (FYP).
I am also a track and field athlete, which motivated me to focus my project on developing an AI model to study, analyze, and provide feedback for improving running technique in sprint athletes using Computer Vision.
 
I have seen your work on sports pose estimation, particularly the AthleticsPose and unsupervised-fine-tuning-pose3d-for-sports repositories.

I am currently using the provided 2D and 3D pose data (.npy files, bounding boxes, and 2D markers) from the AthleticsPose Dataset as my Ground Truth (GT). However, to implement the Computer Vision detection component and perform the crucial fine-tuning of my base pose model, I would need the original visual input data (it doesnt matter in video or images).

I understand that the raw video footage or image frames (RGB) captured by the synchronized cameras are not included in the public release, likely due to file size and privacy concerns.

I would be extremely grateful to know if it is possible for your research team to grant me access, under a strict academic and non-commercial agreement, to a subset of the original image frames used to generate the AthleticsPose data. This would be huge for me helping me train my model with the high-speed data you collected.

I wish you could contact me about this if possible, i will leave you here my email and linkedIn profile. I thank you in advanced.
